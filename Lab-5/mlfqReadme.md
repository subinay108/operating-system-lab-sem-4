# Multilevel feedback queue scheduler
C program to simulate multilevel feedback queue scheduler

Multi-level feedback queue scheduler Q consists of 3 linear queues, i.e., Q1, Q2, and Q3.
- Q1 is round robin with time quantum 5 (RR5),
- Q2 is round robin with time quantum 8 (RR8), and
- Q3 follows first come first serve (FCFS)
- The process cannot be executed in the lower queue if there are any jobs in all higher
queues. For example, Q1 has 5 processes, Q2 has 1 process, and Q3 has 1 process.
Then, first the process in Q1 should be executed (and completed), and then a
process in Q2 is executed. Finally, Q3 will get CPU resource.
-  A new process enters queue Q1 which is served RR5.
• When it gains CPU, a process receives 5 milliseconds.
• If it does not finish in 5 milliseconds, the process is moved to queue Q2.
• At Q2 process is again served RR8 and receives 8 additional milliseconds.
• If it still does not complete, it is preempted and moved to queue Q3.
• At Q3 process is executed by first come first serve.
• If it still does not complete, it is processed at Q2 until completed.

OUTPUT:
The remaining time of processes in each queue level, total waiting time and total turnaround time are displayed.
